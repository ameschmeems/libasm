200          ; decimal
0200         ; still decimal - the leading 0 does not make it octal
0200d        ; explicitly decimal - d suffix
0d200        ; also decimal - 0d prefex
0c8h         ; hex - h suffix, but leading 0 is required because c8h looks like a var
0xc8         ; hex - the classic 0x prefix
0hc8         ; hex - for some reason NASM likes 0h
310q         ; octal - q suffix
0q310        ; octal - 0q prefix
11001000b    ; binary - b suffix
0b1100_1000  ; binary - 0b prefix, and by the way, underscores are allowed
